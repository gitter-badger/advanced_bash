Traditionally regular expressions are performed
using an external program such as grep, sed, or awk.
However, one feature of the double bracket test in
BASH is the ability to perform regex without an
external dependency. This can be done like this:

[[ "${PHONE}" =~ ^(\(?[0-9]{3}\)?[\ |-]?){1,2}[0-9]{4}$ ]]
